# Instanced Sprite Renderer for Unity's ECS

This project is a simple example of how Unity's new Entity Component System (ECS) in 2018.1.14f1 can be used to create a performant instanced sprite renderer. Find out about the [new ECS in Unity here](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/EntityComponentSystemSamples).

The assets used in the example are from [Kenney's Animal Pack](https://kenney.nl/).

## Quick Start
1. Make sure you have [this version of Unity 2018.1.0b12](https://beta.unity3d.com/download/ed1bf90b40e6/public_download.html) installed
2. Make sure the manifest.json file located at `.../[PROJECT FOLDER]/Packages/manifest.json` looks like this:
```
{
  "dependencies": {
      "com.unity.entities": "0.0.12-preview.19",
      "com.unity.package-manager-ui": "1.9.11",
      "com.unity.modules.ui": "1.0.0"
    },
    "testables": [
      "com.unity.collections",
      "com.unity.entities",
      "com.unity.jobs"
    ],
}
```
3. Download [this .unitypackage file](https://github.com/toinfiniityandbeyond/ecs-instanced-sprite-renderer/releases/download/0.2/ECS.Instanced.Sprite.Renderer.unitypackage) and import it.
4. Open **SpriteRendererScene** and press play.

## How it Works
By adding `SpriteInstanceRenderer` to an entity it is rendered using its `Position` and `Rotation` as a quad with a texture on it.  The `SpriteInstanceRender` inherits `ISharedComponentData` meaning any entity using same instance of will be drawn in one draw call. This is possible because of [Graphics.DrawMeshInstanced](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Graphics.DrawMeshInstanced.html) method. In the Example Scene included, 10,000 sprites are drawn. However the before mentioned method only draws a maximum of 1023 instances at once, so it splits up into as many groups necessary to draw all the instances.

## Limitations
* No way to push the matrices from a job
* No NativeArray API, currently uses `Matrix4x4[]`

As a result this code is not yet jobified. For now, we have to copy our data into Matrix4x4[] with a specific upper limit of how many instances we can render in one batch.
